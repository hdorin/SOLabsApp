# SOLabsApp

This interactive web application consists of an Apache Web Server which the students will interact with, a Linux machine which will handle the execution of code using Docker containers and a MySQL Database server. Of course, the web server will limit the extent to which a certain student will have access to the Linux environment.

Regarding the deployment, my application may use three separate machines or only one. The operating system doesn't matter, except for the Linux machine which executes the code, as long as it can host a MySQL Server and a web server which can execute PHP. I only tested it on Ubuntu because I couldn't install the SSH libraries for PHP on Windows 10.
